# L-osti-d-bot

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

You will need to install NodeJS and NPM for the bot to run.
Also, you will need to have FFMPEG installed on the machine you wish to run the bot.

## Installing

Open a command prompt in the root folder of the bot and run "npm install"
then, all you need to do is "node ."

## Deployment

I suggest using pm2 to deploy the bot on a Linux server. 
PM2 is a node module that runs NodeJS scripts as a daemon and offers monitoring.
