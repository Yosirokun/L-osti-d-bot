# L-osti-d-bot

## Prerequisites

You will need to install NodeJS and NPM for the bot to run.
Also, you will need to have FFMPEG installed on the machine you wish to run the bot.

## Installing

Open a command prompt in the root folder of the bot and run "npm install"
then, all you need to do is "node ." to run the bot script.

## Deployment

I suggest using pm2 to deploy the bot on a Linux server. 
PM2 is a node module that runs NodeJS scripts as a daemon and offers monitoring.
